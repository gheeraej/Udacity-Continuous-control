# Udacity-Continuous-control

## Project details
This project is part of the Udacity Deep Reinforcement Learning nanodegree.
The goal of this project is to solve the Reacher environment. In this environment, a double-jointed arm can move to target locations. A reward of +0.1 is provided for each step that the agent's hand is in the goal location. Thus, the goal of your agent is to maintain its position at the target location for as many time steps as possible.

The observation space consists of 33 variables corresponding to position, rotation, velocity, and angular velocities of the arm. Each action is a vector with four numbers, corresponding to torque applicable to two joints. Every entry in the action vector should be a number between -1 and 1.

The environment is considered solved if a reward of +100 is obtain for 30 consecutive episodes.

The method to use is an actor-critic algorithm, the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG) algorithm.
